Some info about dot notation and bracket notation..

dot notation is used like -->       course.title;
bracket notation is used like -->   course["title"];

both are same but dot notation doesn't work properly in some cases where a property is kind of --> wg:image

Here we can access this property in this way -->    course["wg:image"]
dot notation won't work well for the above property and it will throw error.
